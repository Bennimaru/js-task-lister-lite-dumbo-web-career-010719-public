# TaskLister Lite™️

## Hello and Welcome to TaskLister Lite™️

Today you'll be creating a simple to do list application that will focus on DOM manipulation. Take a look at `index.html` and identify the DOM elements you'll need to manipulate before you write any code.

Check out the [working demo][example].

### Instructions:

1. Fork and clone this repository and open in your text editor
2. Open `index.html` in Chrome (Tip: you can use `open index.html` in bash and, as long as Chrome is your default application for opening `.html` files, it will automatically open the file)
3. Put you JavaScript knowledge to the test and work your way through the deliverables

>**Note:** Instead of relying on unit tests, this lab is deliverable driven. You will be responsible for asserting your solution works as intended by testing the behavior *in the console* and *visually in the browser*.
>
>You'll need to create and load in your own JavaScript files. As your file grows, think about how you might break this file into multiple files. 

### Deliverables:

> **Note:** Do these steps **ONE AT A TIME**. If you skip around, you will be sad.

- A user should be able to type a task into the input field and submit to create a new task
- When a user creates a new task, the task should show up in the task list
- A user should be able to delete an item from the list
- A user should be able to create a new list
- A user should be able to add a task to any list
